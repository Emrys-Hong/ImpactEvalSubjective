There are, however, several drawbacks of homeschooling that deserve to be discussed. For one, homeschooling can be less structured and more subject-focused than traditional schooling, which can lead to an unbalanced education. Additionally, homeschoolers are at risk for not getting the same social skills and structure as students in traditional school, and without the guidance of a teacher, they may have problems with learning how to get along with others.

This argument is based on the fact that plastics are non-biodegradable and have a number of environmental risks such as pollution, infiltration and leakage, as well as affecting the natural environment.

This can lead to discrimination or exacerbating existing racial, gender, and economic disparities in the criminal justice system. Furthermore, because AI systems collect large amounts of data that can be difficult to interpret and process, they can create unfair outcomes or unduly influence a biased decision. In addition, some AI systems may fail to detect potential biases or misuse data in some cases.

The argument for regulation rests on the idea that unchecked access to personal data can lead to serious harm and violations of people's privacy.
